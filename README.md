**PROBLEM STATEMENT ![ref1]**

In an era where health awareness is growing, individuals increasingly seek personalized nutrition guidance. However, most existing tools provide generic diet plans, lack real-time adaptability, and fail to consider a person's holistic lifestyle, cultural preferences, allergies, and evolving health conditions.

Furthermore, dieticians and nutritionists face limitations in scaling personalized consultations due to time and resource constraints.

Proposed Solution: ![ref2]

An AI  Nutrition Agent that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an AI-powered assistant can generate dynamic meal plans, recommend smart food swaps, and explain nutritional choicesâ€”all tailored to the individual.
